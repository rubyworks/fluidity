<h2 id="label-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Fluidity is a an assertions notation built on top of the Assay assertions
framework. It defines a set of methods that provide a fluid notation for
specify test assertions.</p>

<p>Assay defines assertions in the same way that Ruby defines exceptions.
Assay provides a complete set of these assertion classes for all common
assertion needs. See <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/assay">Assay</a>
project for more information on this foundational library.</p>

<h2 id="label-USAGE">USAGE</h2>

<p>Developers want to write assertions easily and concisely. To this end
Fluidity provides a flexible grammar system which can be used by requiring
any of the prime grammar methods that extend Object. The most common is
probably `should`.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'fluidity/should'</span>

<span class="ruby-value">10</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">should</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">be</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">kind_of</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">Integer</span>)
</pre>

<p>But if you are accustom to MiniTest’s spec methods, you might prefer
`must`.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'fluidity/must'</span>

<span class="ruby-value">10</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">must</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">be</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">kind_of</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">Integer</span>)
</pre>

<p>Also provided is `assert` for those techy aficionados.</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'fluidity/assert'</span>

<span class="ruby-value">10</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">assert</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">kind_of</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">Integer</span>)
</pre>

<p>So what is so fluid about all this? Well, Fluidity allows the developer
quite the English like expression. For instance.</p>

<pre>10.should.not.be.an.instance_of?(String)</pre>

<p>Pretty neat, though perhaps bit excessive for a real-life use. Generally
it’s good enough to use the shorter and a tad bit faster:</p>

<pre>10.shouldnt.be.instance_of?(String)</pre>

<p>Speaking of <em>fast</em>, so what about speed? Of course, running through
multiple extra method calls to make an assertion is going to be slower than
making just a single method call. So, yes, tests might run a bit slower on
Fluidity than they would with another less readable assertions system.
However, method calls are pretty dang fast and unlikely to present any
significant performance  overhead on test runs. At most, tests runs might
take a few additional seconds for <em>very</em> <em>large</em> test suites.</p>
